# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide the organization with insights to ride-share data. The analysis will give an overview on the amount of rides by city type, fares by city type, and drivers by city type. The three main city types are urban, suburban, and rural. The insights from this analysis should allow the organization to make more informed decisions on pricing and resources needed for each city type. 

## Results
The below image provides an overview on the differences in ride-sharing data among the main city types:

* As expected, urban areas contain the most drivers and rural contains the least. 
* The urban areas have more drivers than total rides, a supply issue that will drive down fares. 
* The avg fare per ride and per driver are highest in rural areas and lowest in urban areas. 

## Summary
Following this analysis, the below recommendations are being made to address the disparity in city types:
* There are more urban drivers than there are riders. Offer incentive for urban drivers to give rides in suburban areas. There could be a long term impact if urban drivers aren't able to find rides to give as they will not be motivated to continue offering rides on Pyber. 
* Closely monitor the "Average Fare per Ride" in suburban and rural areas moving forward. If these rates continue to climb too steep Pyber will risk losing users to competitors. 
* Rerun this analysis on a weekly basis to monitor the impact of any strategic moves made from this point on.
